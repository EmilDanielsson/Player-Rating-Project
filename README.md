# Player_Rating_Project
==============================

Instruction of how to run the files, and what needs to be downloaded beforehand, for the Player_Rating_Project. Project has been carried out at Uppsala university for the course "Advanced Course on Topics in Scientific Computing I", HT2021 period 1.

Python Packages needed
------------
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `json`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `mplsoccer`
- `sklearn`
- `statsmodels`
- `tabulate`

Getting Started
------------
Make sure to have Python3 downloaded, along with needed packages listed above.

Change the name of folder that contains this whole repo: `python-project-template` -> `{your project name}`  

From within the repo directory, first remove git tracking from the project  


The project template uses a placeholder name of 'da-project'. Change that name in the following files/directories (relative to the repo root):
- `da-project/` (change the name of the folder)  
- `./docker/run/`  
- `./docker/build/`

If you have not already done so, build the Docker image (you will only need to do this once)

`docker/build`

Run a Docker container:

`docker/run`  

This will open a bash shell within the Docker container. Within the container the 'project' directory on the host machine (as specified as a parameter of `run` above) will map to `/opt/src/` within the container. You can now access the full file structure of this template from within the container.

Run a Jupyter Notebook within Docker container:

`docker/jupyter`

You will need to open the link that is displayed in your terminal.

To exit:

`exit`  

Initialize a new git repository:

`git init`
